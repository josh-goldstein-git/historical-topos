Accessing Historical topo maps within Scholars GeoPortal allows scanned map sheets to be found by location. Once found they can be viewed either independently or along with other maps sheets to visualize changes over time. In addition, they can be downloaded for personal use and their rich metadata can be explored. Please follow the steps below to learn how to perform each of these tasks.

## Finding Maps

### Loading the index

The first step to access a Historical topo map sheet requires loading the index. There are two index maps, one each for the 1:63,360 and 1:25,000 scales.

1. Enter either “63k index” or “25k index” in the search block, and click the “Search” button. This will display the relevant index in the search results. <br><br>

2. Click the “Add” button to load this index to the map. A notification will be displayed, “You are in Index Search Mode. Click a cell to show the available maps for that area”.
3. Click “Zoom” for the index layer to centre the map over the index’s area of coverage.

4. The index appears as several rectangular cells which trigger a search when clicked.

### Navigating the index

As with other layers in the Geoportal, with an index map is loaded, you can pan and zoom to interactively see the index coverage area. NTS map sheet numbers are displayed in the center of the grid cells for easy identification.

Navigating to an area of interest and clicking the corresponding rectangular cell updates the search results revealing the historical topographic map sheets available for that area. The selected cell remains highlighted indicating where you have selected.

## Exploring the Maps

### Viewing Map Sheets 

After you have selected an area of interest on the index, Click the “View” button beside the desired map to load it to the map viewer. Clicking the “Zoom” button after the map has been loaded will fill the map area to the map sheet’s boundaries.

### Viewing multiple map sheets

Depending upon which index cell you have selected there may be more than one map sheet. To view more than one map sheet at the same time:

1. Click the “View” button for as many map sheets as you like.
2. It’s likely that these maps sheets will overlap, so you will only see the last sheet you selected to “View”. To see the map sheets together, click the “Map” tab at the top left of GeoPortal interface and use the sliderbar  to adjust the transparency of the top layer, revealing the ones beneath it.

### Accessing Metadata

Rich metadata has been created for each map sheet which can be explored by clicking the “Details” button associated with the map sheet. This brings up the metadata pane, showing an abstract, a thumbnail, additional documentation and more.

### Downloading map sheets

Each map sheet can be downloaded by clicking the “Download” button. This will trigger a pop-up and thus might require your browser's pop-up blocker to be disabled (though clicking the “Download” button again should overcome this).  

## Advanced Searching

### Search by Place of Address

If you know the name of the location you are looking for, you can search for it.

1. Click the button for  “Place of Address” (above the search field)
2. Enter the location name of interest. E.g “exeter ON”
3. When you click the “search” button, the results show geocoded locations which can be zoomed too, by clicking the “Zoom” button. <br>

4. Once you zoom into this location, if it falls within a historical topographic index cell, you can click the index layer to show the map sheets.

### Search by National Topographic System (NTS) number

If you know the NTS number, you can search through the index itself.

1. With an index map loaded, click the “Data Table” button from the top right of the Geoportal interface. This will bring up a pane below the map making a query search possible.

2. This query search allows a specific NTS to be found by clicking the “Query” button on the top left of the Data Table pane.

3. Entering a custom query, such as Sheet = '040P14' (for the 63k collection) and clicking execute will isolate the specified map sheet
4. Clicking the resultant record zooms to that location on the map
