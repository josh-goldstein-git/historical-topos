## Overview

The OCUL Historical Topographic Map Digitization project was initiated by the Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Geo Community in 2014. It is a 2.5 year initiative to digitize and georeference early-to-mid 20th century historical topographic maps covering the province of Ontario at the scales of 1:25,000 and 1:63,360. Our goal is to create and provide access through [Scholars Geoportal](http://geo.scholarsportal.info) to a high quality, consistent digital collection that preserves historical topographic information and meets the needs of current and future users.

The project, distributed across several university libraries, adds approximately 1100 maps to our collective digital holdings, including most known sheets covering Ontario from the 1:63,360 and 1:25,000 national topographic map series. Ontario universities have contributed their support by supplying and scanning maps, georeferencing the digital images, creating metadata for the records, and testing the display interface.

Topographic maps at these scales are heavily used by researchers interested in examining changes over time (urban sprawl, transportation patterns, diminishing woodlots, shoreline erosion, etc).

The OCUL Geo Community is a forum for the exchange of information and ideas pertaining to maps, geospatial data, and other cartographic resources, both print and digital, within the wider Ontario Council of University Libraries.

## Technical Specifications

The following presents the steps taken to digitize all of Ontario’s public-domain historical topographic maps at the 1:25,000 and 1:63,360 scales. These technical specifications are presented as a set of scanning and georeferencing guidelines for the project. This can also serve as a useful reference for other institutions undertaking map digitization projects.

### Digitization
Print maps were digitized at 600 ppi resolution and 24-bit colour depth with Colortrac feed-through scanners (models SmartLF Gx+ T56 and SmartLF SG), using standardized colour normalization and stitch correction processes. Manual quality control methods were applied to each digitized sheet to ensure images were straightened and cropped appropriately. Images were also manually inspected for the presence of scanning artifacts; affected images were either corrected or the sheet was flagged for re-scanning.

### Derivative Images
ImageMagick software was used within a custom script to generate three different-sized derivative images for each digitized sheet in JPEG format. A ‘large’ JPEG derivative was generated by scaling the original TIFF image by 50%; a ‘medium’ JPEG derivative was generated by scaling the original TIFF to a 2000 pixel-wide image; and, a ‘small’ JPEG derivative was generated by scaling the original TIFF to a 204 pixel-wide image.

### Georeferencing and Georectification
A total of 8 to 12 ground control points (GCPs) were established for each digitized map using ArcMap software (versions 10.1 to 10.5). Georeferencing and reprojection for each map was carried out using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) functions gdal_translate and gdalwarp, respectively. A custom script was used to automate the conversion of ArcMap GCP files to GDAL format, as well as the georeferencing and warping processes. As part of the warping process, geotiffs were projected to the NAD83 datum, and into the appropriate UTM zone.

### Tiled Web Map Generation
Each georectified image was transformed into a collection of tiled web maps using the gdal2tiles library within a custom script. Tiles were generated in Web Mercator projection (EPSG: 3857) for zoom levels 6 through 16.

All processing scripts may be accessed through the [project Github repository](https://github.com/jasonbrodeur/OCUL_HTDP).
