[Scholars GeoPortal](http://geo.scholasportal.info) is an online portal that allows users to find and download geospatial data and maps. Using the GeoPortal and the built-in map index navigation, users can view map availability by location and add maps to the GeoPortal for viewing independently, or layer maps and other data to visualize changes over time. Maps can be downloaded for personal or research use in GeoTiff or JPG formats. Follow the steps below to learn more about how to access and use the collection in the GeoPortal.

To search for maps directly by place name without entering the GeoPortal, see [‘Browse Full Collection’](../index).

## Finding Maps

### Using the index

The first step to accessing the historical topo map collection is to locate and use the index navigation aid. There are two sets of historical topographic map collections available in the Scholars GeoPortal, each with their own index map for navigation, one for the 1:63,360 and 1:25,000 scale map sets. Using the index navigation, you can view map availability by selecting the area of interest found on the map.

1. In Scholars GeoPortal, maps are available through an interactive online index display. To access the map indexes for different map scales, go directly to the Scholars GeoPortal:

[1:63 360 Index Navigation](http://geo.scholarsportal.info/#r/details/_uri@=564032357)
[1:25 000 Index Navigation](Link)

Note: You can also find the indexes by searching for “Historical Topographic Index” in the search field. <br><br>

2. Click the “Add” button to load this index to the map. A notification will be displayed, “You are in Index Search Mode. Click a cell to show the available maps for that area”.
3. Click “Zoom” for the index layer to centre the map over the index’s area of coverage.

4. The index appears as several rectangular cells which trigger a search when clicked.

### Navigating the index

As with other layers in the Geoportal, with an index map is loaded, you can pan and zoom to interactively see the index coverage area. NTS map sheet numbers are displayed in the center of the grid cells for easy identification.

Navigating to an area of interest and clicking the corresponding rectangular cell updates the search results revealing the historical topographic map sheets available for that area. The selected cell remains highlighted indicating where you have selected.

## Exploring the Maps

### Viewing Map Sheets 

After you have selected an area of interest on the index, Click the “View” button beside the desired map to load it to the map viewer. Clicking the “Zoom” button after the map has been loaded will fill the map area to the map sheet’s boundaries.

### Viewing multiple map sheets

Depending upon which index cell you have selected there may be more than one map sheet. To view more than one map sheet at the same time:

1. Click the “View” button for as many map sheets as you like.
2. It’s likely that these maps sheets will overlap, so you will only see the last sheet you selected to “View”. To see the map sheets together, click the “Map” tab at the top left of GeoPortal interface and use the sliderbar  to adjust the transparency of the top layer, revealing the ones beneath it.

### Accessing Metadata

Rich metadata has been created for each map sheet which can be explored by clicking the “Details” button associated with the map sheet. This brings up the metadata pane, showing an abstract, a thumbnail, additional documentation and more.

### Downloading map sheets

Each map sheet can be downloaded by clicking the “Download” button. This will trigger a pop-up and thus might require your browser's pop-up blocker to be disabled (though clicking the “Download” button again should overcome this).  

## Advanced Searching

### Search by Place of Address

If you know the name of the location you are looking for, you can search for it.

1. Click the button for  “Place of Address” (above the search field)
2. Enter the location name of interest. E.g “exeter ON”
3. When you click the “search” button, the results show geocoded locations which can be zoomed too, by clicking the “Zoom” button. <br>

4. Once you zoom into this location, if it falls within a historical topographic index cell, you can click the index layer to show the map sheets.

### Search by National Topographic System (NTS) number

If you know the NTS number, you can search through the index itself.

1. With an index map loaded, click the “Data Table” button from the top right of the Geoportal interface. This will bring up a pane below the map making a query search possible.

2. This query search allows a specific NTS to be found by clicking the “Query” button on the top left of the Data Table pane.

3. Entering a custom query, such as Sheet = '040P14' (for the 63k collection) and clicking execute will isolate the specified map sheet
4. Clicking the resultant record zooms to that location on the map
