Website for the Historical Topographic Maps Digitization Project.

Built with the [Hugo static website generator](https://gohugo.io/). Also uses the [Codyhouse jQuery image slider](https://codyhouse.co/gem/css-jquery-image-comparison-slider/) and the [elevateZoom-plus jQuery plugin](https://github.com/igorlino/elevatezoom-plus).

The repo does not include the static/img folder for file size reasons.
