    "<strong>More coming soon!</strong><br><br>The OCUL Historical Topographic Map Digitization project was initiated by the Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Geo Community in 2014. It is a 2.5 year initiative to digitize and georeference early-to-mid 20th century historical topographic maps covering the province of Ontario at the scales of 1:25,000 and 1:63,360. Our goal is to create and provide access through Scholars Geoportal to a high quality, consistent digital collection that preserves historical topographic information and meets the needs of current and future users. <br><br> The maps on the home page represent a sampling of the approximately 1100 maps in the collection."
